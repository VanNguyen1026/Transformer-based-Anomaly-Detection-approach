# Transformer-based-Anomaly-Detection-approach
This is the code for our "A novel Transformer-based Anomaly Detection approach for ECG Monitoring Healthcare System" paper
To improve results (centralized version) in Transformer-based Anomaly Detection approach proposed by Raza et al.[1] in term of controlling false alarm rate and accuracy, we integrate the MEWMA technique and the idea of control chart when computing the threshold for detecting anomalies.
